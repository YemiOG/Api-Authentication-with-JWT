# API Authentication with JWT
Install application with 'npm install'


Start with 'npm start'


Authentication will verify a user’s identity through the acquisition of credentials they registered with (email and password) and using those credentials to confirm the user’s identity. The authorisation process begins if the credentials are legitimate. Authorisation occurs after the system authenticates user identity, granting complete access. The authorisation process always follows the authentication procedure. The authenticated and authorised users' will be stored in MongoDB.
